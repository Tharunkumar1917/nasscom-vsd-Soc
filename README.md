- __what are PDK's ?__(Process Design Kits)

 A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a collection of files and data provided by a semiconductor foundry that describes the manufacturing process of a chip at a specific technology node (e.g., 
 130nm, 28nm). It includes information such as design rules, standard cell libraries, SPICE models, and technology files required for physical design, simulation, and verification.
 
-  __Google sky 130nm PDK__
  
  The SkyWater 130nm PDK is an open-source PDK developed by SkyWater Technology and released in collaboration with Google. It targets the 130nm technology node and provides resources for 
  chip designers to create silicon without proprietary restrictions, democratizing chip design by allowing free and open access to the design tools and libraries.
  
- __Role of Openlane in RTS to GDS 2__

  OpenLane is an open-source ASIC design flow that automates the conversion of RTL to GDSII, leveraging tools like Yosys for synthesis, OpenROAD for physical design, and Magic for layout 
  verification. It simplifies the design process by integrating all necessary tools and ensuring the design complies with the PDK's rules, making it an essential platform for open 
  hardware projects using PDKs like SkyWater 130nm.

- __Decouplng Capacitors__

  Decoupling capacitors are capacitors placed between the power supply (Vcc) and ground (GND) to smooth out voltage fluctuations and filter noise from the power lines that could affect the performance of sensitive components in the circuit.
  
__How Do Decoupling Capacitors Work?__
When the power supply experiences a transient or voltage dip (such as when a component suddenly switches on), the decoupling capacitor charges to supply the required current.
Similarly, if there is a voltage spike, the capacitor discharges, absorbing the excess energy and preventing it from reaching the rest of the circuit.

- __Power-Planning__

Power planning in chip design refers to the process of designing and organizing the power distribution network within an integrated circuit (IC) or chip. This network ensures that all components on the chip receive the required voltage and current levels to function correctly, efficiently, and reliably.

 - __why do multiple VDD and VSS are used in Floor-planning?__

VDD and VSS are the primary power and ground connections for the entire chip. As chips grow in size and complexity, a single pair of VDD and VSS lines may not be sufficient to deliver power evenly to all parts of the chip.
Multiple VDD and VSS lines help distribute power efficiently across the chip, ensuring that all components have stable and reliable access to the voltage they require.

 - __Pin-Placement__

 Pin placement in chip floor planning refers to the process of determining where the input/output (I/O) pins of an integrated circuit (IC) will be located on the chip's 
 surface. These pins are the electrical contacts through which the chip interacts with the external environment, including other chips, devices, or the power supply.

## Cell design flow

Cell design flow refers to the series of steps or stages involved in the creation of a standard cell for an integrated circuit (IC). Standard cells are the fundamental building blocks used in digital ICs (such as logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.), and the design of these cells involves a detailed process that ensures they meet the required performance, area, and power specifications.
<details>
Steps in the Cell Design Flow:
           
- __Specification and Architecture Definition:__

Functional Specification: Define the desired functionality of the cell (e.g., an AND gate, D flip-flop).
Performance Goals: Determine the target performance, including timing constraints (e.g., propagation delay, setup time, etc.), power consumption, and area requirements.
Power Consumption Requirements: Specify the maximum allowable power consumption and leakage currents.

-__Schematic Design:__

Create a schematic diagram of the cell that represents the logical connections between components (transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.).
The schematic should accurately reflect the intended functionality of the cell.

-__Transistor Sizing:__
Choose appropriate sizes for the transistors in the cell based on the required electrical characteristics like drive strength, switching speed, and power consumption.
Aspect ratio (width to length) of transistors plays a key role in determining the cell's performance and area.

-__Layout Design:__

The schematic is translated into a physical layout, where the actual placement and routing of transistors and other components are defined.
The layout is optimized for the process node (e.g., 7nm, 14nm) and considers factors like density, congestion, and design rules for the fabrication process.

-__DRC (Design Rule Check):__

Perform a Design Rule Check (DRC) to ensure the layout complies with the manufacturing processâ€™s geometrical constraints (minimum width, spacing, etc.). DRC ensures the design can be fabricated correctly and avoids physical errors like shorts or opens.

-__Extraction and Parasitic Modeling:__

- Extract the parasitic capacitances, resistances, and inductances from the layout.
Create parasitic models that are used to simulate the behavior of the cell under real-world conditions, accounting for the physical layout's impact on electrical performance.
Timing and Electrical Analysis:

- Perform timing analysis to determine the delay characteristics (e.g., propagation delay, rise/fall times) of the cell.
Ensure that the cell meets the required timing constraints (setup time, hold time, and clock skew).
Power analysis is also done to check for dynamic and static power consumption (including leakage).

-__SPICE Simulation:__

Simulate the cell's electrical behavior using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) to validate the performance, including delay, power, and noise characteristics.
Ensure the cell works correctly in a range of conditions (e.g., different supply voltages and temperatures).

-__Verification (Functional and Electrical):__

Perform functional verification to ensure that the cell operates as intended in all possible scenarios.
Conduct electrical verification to ensure the cell meets all the necessary electrical constraints, such as voltage levels, current limits, and power consumption.

-__Cell Characterization:__

Characterize the cell for timing and power, generating libraries of values that can be used in the design flow of higher-level circuit designs.
Characterization involves running simulations at different process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners and compiling delay, power, and noise data.

-__Library Generation:__

After characterization, generate a standard cell library that includes the electrical, timing, and physical data for each cell.
The library will contain models for various operating conditions and process corners, which are used during the Place and Route (P&R) stages of larger IC designs.

-__Post-Layout Simulation and Signoff:__

Perform post-layout simulations to verify the final layout works as expected with parasitic effects included.
Ensure the cell meets all design rules, timing requirements, and electrical constraints before the cell is signoff for production.

-__Tapeout:__

Once the cell passes all tests, the final design is sent for tapeout, which is the preparation of the final mask data for the manufacturing process.

- __Timing Characterisation__

Timing characterization is the process of determining the delay, setup, hold, and propagation times of a cell or circuit under various operating conditions (such as voltage, temperature, and process variations). It generates timing models that are used in larger chip designs for accurate performance analysis and optimization.

In OpenLane, the run_placement step is responsible for placing the standard cells within the design area. Placement is a critical stage in the physical design flow where standard cells are positioned on the chip layout according to the logical netlist while considering design constraints and physical resources.

### Initial global placement ##

Initial Global Placement is the first step in the placement stage of the ASIC physical design flow. It aims to place standard cells within the chip's core area in an approximate manner to minimize wirelength and congestion while keeping the design scalable for further optimization and legalization.

Key Tasks of run_placement

to run placement:
```
run_placement
```
__Standard Cell Placement__:

The primary function is to place standard cells (small pre-designed logic units like AND, OR, flip-flops) in the specified rows and sites within the core area.
Ensures cells are aligned properly to the placement grid.

__Initial (Global) Placement:__

The cells are initially placed with the goal of minimizing wirelength and congestion.
Tools like RePLace (global placement) or OpenROAD's placement engine are used.

__Legalization:__

Adjusts the positions of the standard cells to ensure:
Cells do not overlap.
Placement adheres to row boundaries and design rules.
Cells align to the placement grid.

__Placement Optimization:__

The placement step optimizes the layout for:
Wirelength minimization.
Timing and congestion reduction.
It may also consider power/ground (P/G) grid constraints.

### Variation in VTC a Inverter due to different ratios of \( W/L \) for NMOS and PMOS ###
### Effect of \( W/L \) Ratios on Inverter VTC

1. **Balance between NMOS and PMOS**: The \( W/L \) ratio for PMOS is typically **larger** than NMOS to compensate for the lower hole mobility in PMOS, ensuring balanced switching characteristics.

2. **VTC Symmetry**: When **NMOS and PMOS** have similar \( W/L \) ratios, the **VTC** is symmetric, with sharp transitions between logic 0 and 1, leading to ideal voltage levels.

3. **Improved Switching Speed**: A **larger \( W/L \) ratio for PMOS** allows the inverter to **pull up** the output faster, resulting in **faster switching** and sharper voltage transitions.

4. **Noise Margins**: Proper sizing of NMOS and PMOS provides **stronger noise margins**, making the inverter more resistant to noise and voltage fluctuations at the input.

5. **Degraded Performance with Poor Sizing**: If the PMOS \( W/L \) ratio is too **small** compared to NMOS, the inverter will have **slower rise times**, a **gradual VTC**, reduced noise margins, and slower switching performance.
